# RoomFinder---Indoor-Navigation-AR-App
This repository contains my Final Year Project called RoomFinder. It is an Android app that utilizes the AR feature to act as a visual guide for finding lecturers' rooms located at the Faculty Building. This project was heavily developed using the <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity Software</a>(2021.2.3f1) and integrates the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/?_gl=1*e9pub1*_up*MQ..&gclid=9b711fd4fa9e155401eb77505c4a807b&gclsrc=3p.ds&hl=en">Google Cloud Platform API</a> to handle the user registration process.
